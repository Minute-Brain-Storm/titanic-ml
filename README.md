# Machine Learning with The RMS Titanic
This project contains all the code for the entry in the Kaggle competition  found here - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

I worked on a version of this for my machine learning class, and I had so much fun working on it that after the semester ended I wanted to revisit and expand on this project. My original project was quite a mess, so I decided to just start from scratch, using my original project as a reference of sorts.

The biggest thing in this project was working with the data. Feature selection and extraction were some of the things that gave me the biggest accuracy boosts. I also got the chance to learn about and work with a variety of different machine learning models. The one that I found the most success with was a simple support vector machine, although xGB had some promising results as well. I also worked with a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, and a linear algorithm. I actually used the latter to estimate missing age values. 

Besides the machine learning, I also got a chance to familiarize myself more with Python and get plenty of experience working with pandas and numpy (I admit, a couple of times I was practically banging my head against the monitor looking at the DataFrame documentation).

Ultimately I was able to score an accuracy of .787, and although I would have liked to break into the .8's, I am more or less satisfied with where I ended up, I am definitely satisfied with what I learned along the way.
